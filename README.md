# python_code_samples
This repository is a collection of Python code examples taken from various projects I created in the past.
All examples were created using python 2.7.

# hiatus_v2.py
This was a project I created to stop and start all applications for maintenance windows.

# privilege_log.py & review_metrics.py
These were two custom reports out of a suite of 14 reports I created that sends data to an ftp location where the end client would download the reports from.

# flask_samples
These are just a few applications I created that were part of a larger internal Flask application.  The entire views.py file is 3,783 lines of code.
